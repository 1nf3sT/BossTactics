L["tacticNalorakk"] =  [[
|cffff0000Trash
------|r

Like in the eastern part of Dire Maul Nalorakk already waits for you at the first crossing to the five parts of Zul'aman. Everytime you get closer to him, he moves backwards step after step and sends his Tribesmen, Axe Throwers, Medicine Men and Bears to you instead. Finally having fought them up to his plateau you meet the Amani'shi Warbringers. These close combat fighters are riding on bears; when they have only 10% of their health left they dismount and the numbers of enemys you have to fight doubles. These groups should be easy to kill and should be no bigger problem for any raid.

Hitpoints: 1.500.000
Close combat: 2.500 - 3.500 Physical Damage (at 10.000 armor)

The fight is devided into two alternating phases.

|cff00ff00Phase 1|r - Humanoide Mode
This mode lasts 45 seconds. In this mode Nalorakk has the following special abilities:

Mangle:
Causes 1.500 physical damage at the actual target and a debuff, which increases the damage done by bleeding effects by 100%.

Surge:
Rushes to a randomly chosen target and hits it with a physical area-effect, which causes physical damage uo to 3.700 points.

Brutal Swipe:
Causes 12.000 physical damage at the actual target.

|cff00ff00Phase 2|r - Bear Mode
In this mode Nalorakk has the following special abilities:

Deafening Roar:
This area-effect causes 500 - 1.000 damage to all raidmembers and silence for 4 seconds.

Rend Flesh:
Hits the actual target for 2.500 - 3.000 physical damage and causes a dot that lasts 5 seconds and causes 2.100 bleeding damage every second.

|cFFDBD5332) The fight
--------------------|r

You will need two tanks for this fight, who will rotate when Nalorakk switches his fight mode. If you have a defensive warrior and an offensive warrior the defensive one should be your tank for the first phase, and the off-warrior the second one, because the damage done by Nalorakk is higher in the first phase.

Nalorakk starts with the humanoide mode. Tank one gets his attention and pulls him to the middle of the platform. The second tank should be standing very closely to the first tank in this phase. When Nalorakk stands in the right position, the damage dealer should start their attacs. When Nalorakk switches into the second phase, the bear mode, the second tank taunts him and keeps his attention for the whole phase. This is absolutely necessary because the tank (of phase 1) is affected by the effect of mangle. When Nalorakk finally switches back to his humanoide form (like phase 1) the first tank has to taunt him again.

The rest of the raid should be arranged in both phases around Nalorakk with enough space between each other to make

The healer have to make sure that the tank has always full hitpoints through the first phase. Otherwise a brutal swipe can cause the tank's death pretty fast. In the bear form the damage tops are not as high as in phase one. Hots and early heals should be enough to keep the tank alive.

L["tacticAkil'zon"] =  [[
|cffff0000Trash
------|r

Akil'zon lives in the north-western part of Zul'Aman. To get to him is pretty hard. At the entrance you meet a Lookou who will, als soon as he gets to see you, move beckwards and call for help. Unfourtenately he is not stunnable or vulnerable for polymorph or things like that. He starts an event that is quite similar to the event in the Shattered Halls. While you have to fight the Wind Walkers and the Beast Tamers every minute two Guardians spawn at the lowest point of the way and 4 eagels will fly down to you from the upper altar. You should always fight only two of the steady mobs and then the eagles and Guardians before you attack the next two.

|cffff0000Tactic
--------|r

|cFFDBD5331) Abilities
------------------|r

The special abilities of the eagle-headed Akil'zon unfourtunately are a little unpleasing for the close combat damage dealers. He is able to call a lightnign that is focused on one target and will also hurt the players next to teh focused one. Further more every 50-60 seconds he starts an electrical storm that comes along with several eagles, which attack your raidmembers. The eagles can be fought by ranged damage dealers.

Static Disruption:
Hurts all enemys in a 12 meter radius for 3.500 nature damage and causes a debuff that will increase all suffered nature damage by 25% for 20 seconds.

Call Lightning:
Hurts the player with the highest threat for 3.300 - 4.200 nature damage.

Gust of Wind:
Throws a player high up into the sky and causes damage when you reach the ground again.

Electrical Storm:
A channeled spell that will throw up a randomly chosen player. All players, that won't move below the player into his shadow within 5 seconds will get hurt by nature damage every second. The amount of damage starts with about 2.400 points and increases every second by 1.000.

Summon Eagles:
Summones flying eagles that will attac randomly chosen players and cause 1.600 damage.

|cFFDBD5332) The Fight
--------------------|r

It's absolutely recommended to use boss-mods like Big Wigs or Deadly Boss Mods. Of course, you can also manage this fight without any mods but it's much easier to find the right moment to meet in the middle of the platform when the electrical storm is incoming.

The tank gets the attention of Akil'zon and moves him to the middle of the platform. The remaining raid should be arranged around Akil'zon with enough space between the players and with the maximum range to Akil'zon. The close combat damagedealer can stand next to Akil'zon, but there shouldn't be more than 2 or 3, because otherwise the static disruption will cause to much damage.

Five seconds before the electrical storm arrives, all players move to the middle of the platform and wait there until the electrical storm has chosen one of them to throw up into the sky. For the right timing of this action the Big Wigs module can help you a lot. You can alternatively try to walk into the middle when the message "A storm comes up" appears. When the chosen player floats into the air, the rest of the raid moves below him into the little shadow and waits there until the storm is over. You have to chose the right moment, because the static disruption will kill your raid if you move to the middle too early.

When the storm is over the eagles will appear. They have only a few hitpoints (about 2.500) and can be killed by the ranged damage dealers. Never the less their number stays the same after every storm, so it is recommended to ignore them at all. If your healers can't manage that, you should kill the eagles.

The storm will appear about 5 or 6 times until Akil'zon finally dies. Apart from the Gust of wind there are no further surprises in this fight. Repeat the discribed tactic and the treasures of Akil'zon will be yours.

L["tacticJan'alai"] =  [[
|cffff0000Trash
------|r

Next on your list is Jan’Alai, you find him in the southeastern part of the instance. Even if the countdown ran out, you have to be quick with the next trashpacks. When engaged, the Amani'shi Scouts will run to a nearby hut and summon more trolls. They can be stunned or slowed and don't have a lot of hit-points. Just nuke them down before they call in the reinforcements. Try not to have too many breaks, otherwise you might be surprised by some Scouts coming from behind. The Amani'shi Guardians you encounter can just be tanked and spanked, the Amani'shi Flame Casters on the other hand cast Fireballs, which should be interrupted. They put a powerful HASTE buff on themselves, which can be dispelled by priests or shamans. Or maybe your mages want to SPELLSTEAL the buff to use it themselves! There are also patrols that include dragonhawks. They should be no problem, just kill the hawks first. After a short while, you should be facing Jan'Alai, avatar of the Dragonhawk.

|cffff0000Tactic
--------|r

|cFFDBD5331) Abilities: 
------------------|r

Flame breath:
The boss casts a Flame Breath on a random player. Everyone in its path gets hit for 4,000 to 5,500 fire damage. 
Fire Bomb:
Jan'Alai teleports these players, who are standing on the bridges or the smaller platforms, to himself and surrounds the platform with flame walls. Then he covers the platform with Fire Bombs that explode all at once after 10 seconds.

Brut:
Every minute, two Hatchers appear and run towards the eggs, releasing one Dragonhawk Hatchling from the first egg, two from the second egg and three from any additional egg they hatch.

Enrage:
Increases attack speed by 50% and damage by 50%. The boss uses this either after 5 minutes or when he is down to 25% hitpoints.

Frenzy: Ten minutes after the fight starts, Jan'Alai goes ballistic and wipes the raid.

|cFFDBD5332) The Fight: 
--------------------|r

1. Flame breath:
The players shouldn't stand to close together, so the flame breath will only hit one or two players. 


2. Fire Bombs:
Jan'alai scatters dozens of small bombs all over the platform. After ten seconds, all bombs blow up at the same time and hit players standing too close. So everyone should pick a bomb free spot to stand on. Don't try to run through the flame walls surrounding the platform during this, they hurt even more than the bombs! After the bombs detonated, the maintank pulls Jan'Alai back to the middle and the raid spreads out again.

3. Eggs:
Since the boss will hatch all of the remaining eggs at once when he hits 35% health, you want the hatchers to get rid of some of the eggs. Kill one of the hatchers immediately after they appear, and then let the other one hatch 3 or maybe 4 eggs before killing him as well. The hatchlings should be bound by the second tank, and killed as fast as possible.

L["tacticHalazzi"] =  [[
|cffff0000Trash
------|r

Halazzi is the Amani lord of lynxes. He switches phases at 75%, 50% and 25% hitpoints. While the first phase is tank and spank only, you have to deal with a ghost lynx and a lot of damage to the raid in the second phase.

|cffff0000Tactic
--------|r

|cFFDBD5331) Abilities: 
------------------|r

Melee damage: 1.800 - 3.600 (at 10.000 armor)

Saber Lash - Phase 1
Melee attack that hits the maintank and anyone standing close to him. The damage is divided up evenly, so have both tanks stand on top of each other, they will then get hit for around 7,000 to 8,000 damage each, depending on armor. Only used in phase one.

Frenzy - Phase 1
A buff Halazzi casts to himself. It increases the attack speed by 30% for 10 seconds. The effect can be dispelled by a hunter.

Phase switch
By switching from phase 1 to phase 2, Halazzi causes 4.000 - 4.400 nature damage to all players in the room

Ghost lynx - Phase 2
The Spirit of Halazzi, a ghost lynx, appears and attacks the raid, he should be picked up by the second tank while the first tank stays on Halazzi. He won't use SABER LASH in this phase. The ghost lynx starts with full live, and will return to Halazzi when his hitpoints are below 20%. Halazzi will have nearly full live again when the lynx turns back to him. 

Corrupted Lightning Totem - Phase 2 & 3
A totem that casts chain lightning on a random player for 5,000 damage. The chain lightning jumps over to nearby players, so have your raid spread out well. Must be destroyed fast. Only used in phase two and during the last 25% health.

Flame Shock - Phase 2
Hits a random player for around 4,500 fire damage and leaves a DoT that ticks for 4,000 damage every 3 seconds. It counts as magic and must be dispelled. Only used in phase two.



|cFFDBD5332) The Fight
--------------------|r

|cff00ff00Phase 1|r
You need two tanks for this fight, and there are two different phases Halazzi switches between. The first phase is quite simple - just tank the boss in the middle of the room and do damage. Halazzi will enrage from time to time, which makes him hit faster. If you brought a hunter, he can dispel this with TRANQUILIZING SHOT. The key ability in this phase is the SABER LASH that hits for around 50,000 damage. A lot of the damage is mitigated by armor and it is divided up between the affected players. Just have both tanks stand together, like they did in the fight against Nalorakk, then the SABER LASH will hit each of them for around 7,000 to 8,000 damage. Once you brought down Halazzi to 75%, phase 2 starts.

Healers must in this phase take care that the main tank has always maximum HP. The Saber Lash in combinition with the normal attacs can take the tank very quickly to 10% HP.

The damage dealers can focus on Halazzi until he reaches 75% (or 50% or 25%) HP.

|cff00ff00Phase 2|r
The switch from phase one to two is begun with about 4,000 nature damage. Damage dealers schould heal themselves. The gost lynx should be tanked about 20m away from Halazzi..

The highest priority in this phase is the Corrupted Lightning Totem, use this makro for easy targeting and casting a spell e.g:

/target Corrupted Lightning Totem
/cast something

Only if there is no totem you should make damage to the gost of the lynx, alternativly you can stay focusing Halazzi, that is better if you have lots of DOTs.

Healer must take care of the two tanks and the group because of the totem and flame shock.

Damage dealers can use trinkets to make this phase as short as possible.

|cff00ff00Phase 3|r
If Halazzi is under 25% he will also go on casting the totem. So be aware and destroy it. Make as much damage to Halazzi as possible, but do not forget the totems! Then you will be the winner.

L["tacticMalacrass"] =  [[

Malacrass can be fighted only if the four previous bosses are killed.

|cffff0000Buffs, Drinks and Amory|r
--------------------------------------------

Hint: On Patchlevel 2.4 it is very hard for Karazhan equipted groups to kill Malacrass because he causes about 9,000 shadow damage every 30 seconds to every player additional to his normal attacs in the other phases.

To resist some of the shadow damage you should wear some shadow resistence and the priest buff is very useful. If you have about 150-200 you will reist about 50% of the damage, more resistence has not much effect.

You should also have as much HP as possible, buff-food and drinks can help you there.

You can try to buff Dampen Magic to reduce the damage, but it also reduces healing.

|cffff0000Tactic
--------|r

|cFFDBD5331) Abilities
------------------|r

Malacrass has three abilities he casts in rotation, which starts 30 seconds after beginning the fingt.

    * 0:30 - 0:40 Spirit Bolts
    * 0:40 - 1:00 Siphon Soul

Spirit Bolts:
Spirit Bolts deal 450 shadow damage to nearby enemies every 0.5 sec for 10 seconds. Can be resisted, but is not subject to line of sight.

Drain Power:
Every minute Malacrass reduces eyery player by 1% and his own damage increases 10%. So this is some sort of enrage timer.

      Control: Sheep
      Abilities: Priest
    * Darkheart (Undead)
      Control: Shackle
      Abilities: mass fear

    * Thurg (Oger)
      Control: Sheep
      Abilities: Meele(up to 6,000 damage, depends on amor)


Position
There is not the best way, you can just try to find the best for your group. 

|cFFDBD5332) The Fight
--------------------|r

Try to control most of the adds and kill two of them.
To control them you can use this makro:

/cast [target=Koragg] control spell

The main tank controlls malacrass and the second tank the add which is next to be killed.

Is the first add dead Malacrass will start his first spirit bolts, healers should try to heal all group members, druid HOTs are the easiest way to do that. Priests should cast shields.

Is this over Malacrass will cast "Siphon Soul". This is the hardest part, because now you have to act different, depending on what class is now affected.

Every minute the damage of malacrass is increased by 10% and your damage and healing is reduced by 1%, so keep track on the time.

Here are some tips how to deal with the sipon soul:

Druid:
Meelies should stop damage and the healings must be dispelled or stopped.

Warlock:
The group should be position over the whole room, to get the fire damage as small as possible. And be aware what you decurse and what not!

Hunter:
The tank should cite Malacrass that the traps take no effect. If there are snakes just kill them with AOE.

Warrior:
Meelies should be carefull because the whirlwind will kill you very quickly. Casters must be aware of the cast reflection.

Mage:
This is very easy because there is not much more damage, just heal everybody very well.

Paladin:
Stopp the healing casts and cite Malacrass as soon as he casts Consecrate. Dispell all the other stuff.

Priest:
Mind control can be dispelled and do not forget to stop the healing casts.

Shaman:
Stop the healing casts and destroy the fire totem, because it makes a lot of addional damage.

Rogue:
Just increase the healing of the tank, the other abilities don't cause that much problems.

L["tacticZul'jin"] =  [[
Zul'jin is the endboss of Zul'aman you can reach him if Malacrass is dead. The fight has five phases which switch every 20% decrease of his life. 
At the beginning of every phase the aggro is completly resettet.

|cffff0000Tactic
--------|r

|cFFDBD5331) Abilities
------------------|r

|cff00ff00Phase 1|r - Troll Form:
Grievous Throw:
1,500-3,500 initial damage on a random player. DoT deals 2,400 damage every 2s, removed if the player has 100% HP.

Whirlwind:
AoE dealing 3k damage on plate, 6k on leather. 2s cast time

|cff00ff00Phase 2|r - Bear Form:
Creeping Paralysis:
Debuff on the entire raid. Deals 4.5k Nature damage after 5.5s, and applies the debuff Paralyzed. Paralyzed players are stunned for 4s. Both debuffs are dispellable magic effects. Rogues, you can use Cloak of Shadows during that 6 second span of the Creeping Paralysis debuff to get to avoid getting stunned.

Overpower:
4.6-5.9k on the tank, ~9s cooldown.

|cff00ff00Phase 3|r - Eagle Form:
Electrical Storm:
Debuff on the entire raid causes every character that uses spells to take 1250 Nature damage, can be resisted.

Tornados:
4 Feather Vortex spawn, they look like tornados and move around. They deal 1k Nature damage and knock players back if they are touched.

|cff00ff00Phase 4|r - Lynx Form:
Claw Charge:
Zul'jin focuses a random player other than the tank, and hits him 12 times with Claw Rage in about 6s. The first strike deals 500 damage. Every strike applies the stackable debuff Claw Rage, which increases the damage taken by consecutive attacks by 150. Thus, the second hit deals 650, the third 800, and so on. The last hit deals 2150 damage, for a total of 16k. Claw Rage attacks cannot miss, be dodged, parried, or blocked. If the focused player feigns/vanishes/etc, Zul'jin will focus the tank.

Lynx Rush:
When he uses this ability, he does so 9 times in a row in quick succession. Every attack targets a random player, and deals about 2k damage, further mitigated by armor. The target is chosen completely random; one player might be targeted multiple times in a row (up to 3?), and he can also target the tank. Every player that was attacked also gets the debuff Lynx Hunt, which deals 1.5k damage every 2s over 10s.

|cff00ff00Phase 5|r - Dragonhawk Form:
Flame Whirl:
He gains this buff, rotates for 2sec, then deals 1k Fire damage to the entire raid (partially resistible). This will also apply a stackable debuff that increases Fire damage taken by 50%, which cannot be resisted. 12sec cooldown.

Column of Fire:
Hits everyone in front of him for 2k Fire damage (partially resistible). 7sec cooldown.

Flame Breath:
Point Blank AoE cast on a random player (or pet), dealing 900 Fire damage every second for 10 seconds. There may be up to 3 columns at the same time.

|cFFDBD5332) Kampfverlauf
--------------------|r

|cff00ff00Phase 1|r - Troll Form (100% - 81%):
Melees watch out for his whirlwind. Healers react quickly to Grievous Throw. Players only lose this DoT when their health reaches 100%. General methods which make players immune to phsysical damage like Paladin bubbles/Ice Block can work here. The dwarven racial Stoneform may also remove it (NEEDS CONFIRMATION!) It is not advised to use Healthstones or Healing Potions to remove it because he can hit the same person several times in succession and these will be much more useful in Phase 4.

Don't forget that the aggro is resetted between phase 1 and 2.

|cff00ff00Phase 2|r - Bär Form (80% - 61%)

In the bear form you should stand together that you can use mass dispell of the "Creeping Paralysis". You must also dispell the maintank by a paladin or priest.

|cff00ff00Phase 3|r - Adler Form (60% - 41%)
The tornados have a fixed algorithm of movement, they'll move to one person, hit them once, and start moving towards another person.

The best way to avoid this is to leave your two best melee dps hitting the boss, and the other members go to the corners of the room, two at the sides of the entrance, two on the left side on each corner, two on the right side on each corner, and two on the bottom of the stairs where Zul'jin is standing, leave a healer at one side of the entrance and one on each side of the room, so each healer will have line of sight of at least six members of the raid, this will minimize the damage taken by the tornados.

The tornados knock you back and deal around 1k damage. If you are a caster (yes healers included) every time you cast you will get hit for about 1250 damage. Heal over time spells really make this phase much easier. Melee need to try and burn him down as quick as they can, as they get no punishment for doing damage. Use bandages. Casters use wands and regenerate mana for the next phases. Hunters may use Arcane Shot, Steady Shot, Multi Shot, Aimed Shot, and Serpent Sting. Hunters will take damage from using Feign Death, Rapid Fire, and switching Aspects. Hunters are important for doing lots of damage during this phase. It is recommended that hunters use Rapid Fire on this phase, even though you will take damage, as a good use of Rapid Fire can really be helpful.

Retribution Paladins can use Crusader Strike without taking damage. Spells with a base mana cost of 0 such as Desperate Prayer, Inner Focus, and Starshards will not cause damage to the caster.

Warlocks can use Shadow Bolts timed in conjunction with Drain Life to nullify the repercussion from casting and maintain DPS. With healing assistance you can get all your DoTs off and take minimal damage.

It's worth mentioning that casters can follow a spell with a casting time by an instant casting spell without getting hit twice by the tornadoes. For example, a druid can cast rejuvenation right after casting regrowth (not necessarily on the same target) and just get hit once. 

Don't forget that the aggro is resetted between phase 3 and 4.

|cff00ff00Phase 4|r - Luchs Form (40% - 21%)
Lynx form he melees fairly weak on the tank. He also will use Claw Rage on a random player in the raid and melee them. Claw Rage is the deadliest ability of this fight Zul'jin will turn towards a player and pause for a second then starts to hit that player several times increasing damage and attack speed every hit doing a lot of damage in a short time. Intervene near the end of the phase (9-11 stacks) to help out cloth wearers. Healers must use fast spells or instant spells, lag can make suvival problematic here. Announce Vanish/Divine Shield/etc to the raid, so healers know that he will change back to the tank. Healers take good care of Lynx Rush victims, as everyone should be topped for the next Claw Rage. He will stop claw rage on the target if the target uses Ice Block, Divine Shield, Blessing of Protection, Vanish, Feign Death and will return to his default highest threat target. The dwarf racial Stoneform can also help mitigate the damage. Druids should use Barkskin and can try to turn into Bear Form if they are fast enough although that limits them from using potions. Everyone needs to be on their toes to stay alive, he's very fast, and your health can drop quickly. Keep Healthstones/potions ready.

|cff00ff00Phase 5|r - Drachenfalken Form (20% - 0%)
Everyone will get a buffet like debuff every so often, increasing fire damage taken. He will choose random people throughout the raid and place a beam of fire on them. They may take lots of damage due to the debuff, so move out of these beams ASAP. It's a simple phase if people are good at staying out of void zones. Spread out so only one person is hit at the same time. Flame Breath will hit the tank for more and more fire damage due to the debuff, so DPS him down as fast as you can. The tank needs to build threat fast, but also stay focused to move out of the beams quickly. Melee stay in his back to avoid getting hit by Flame Breath.
